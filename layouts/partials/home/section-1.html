I specialize in wedding floral , interior design silk floral, hand painted event decor and am well known for luxury designed Christmas trees. </p>
                    <p>My inspiration comes from my two daughters. As a single mom, the one thing that always brightens my day is their beautiful smiles. They have encouraged me to the best me. When Im finished with a design, I look for that in each client; a beautiful smile.</p>
                    <p>I am passionate about color, attentive to detail and love to think outside of the box. </p>
